<h2>About us</h2>
<p>We are the YALiEns Robotics team of Y.A.L.E. School, Cherry Hill, New Jersey. We are FTC Team #6613. You must be a student of Y.A.L.E. School of Cherry Hill. We are currently NOT accepting members from other Y.A.L.E. campuses. We will not accept any members from outside our school.</p>
<p>Our team had our rookie year in 2012 when it was ran by a previous teacher. Since then, that teacher left the school and handed off the power of coach to another teacher at the school. Not much history of our team is known by our current members. Unfortunately, we don't have much communication with the previous members, so we have been running the team under completely new management since then.</p>
<p>He have had many obstacles such as organizing our team in an orderly manner, but have since improved and are conducting the team very well.</p>
